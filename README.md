# GSA OSC Web Presence

## Project Description
18F will work to understand how GSA websites and systems are currently structured, evaluate user needs and challenges, and conduct a review of GSA’s overall digital presence. 18F will then define a strategy and roadmap for how to address the most pressing challenges with the current information architecture of GSA’s websites, ultimately driving towards a simplified site structure that better resonates with users. Following the path analysis, 18F will prepare a synthesis of findings as well as preliminary recommendations identifying the next steps towards developing the requirements for FAS to acquire a solution for OSC.  

During this phase, 18F will provide GSA OSC with the following:

- Problem definition and potential partner impact: The explicit objectives to achieve the organization’s goal(s), based upon an investigation, and the level of impact felt by the Requesting Agency or their user base.
- Strategy, recommendations, and concept: A stated approach to achieve an outcome based on the organization’s unique position, including but not limited to its mission, context, resources, and risks.
- When appropriate, limited prototypes, wireframes, data, or other documents generated by 18F.
