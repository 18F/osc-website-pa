Hi Team,

Completed this week:

-   Prepped for and conducted kickoff meeting for PA

-   Synthesized key takeaways and decisions from kickoff

-   Identified an opportunity to refine the problem statement more strategically, and shared proposal in weekly update

-   Incorporated feedback from weekly update into proposed problem statement, scope, and next steps for Week 2.

Goals for next week:

-   Begin first of two weeks of research

-   Confirm we have the right skills needed for this PA

-   Reminder: [Trello](https://trello.com/b/fGlFYb3w/osc-gsa-web-presence) lists the specific tasks we're working on

What we're seeing/thinking about:

-   What we learned during kickoff meeting

-   GSA services: self-service, full-service, and shared-service

-   A lot of research has been done: Key pain points have been identified. Surveys have been conducted.

-   This PA needs to build off of other work already done, inform work waiting in the wings.

-   Long term goals

-   Let's focus on reducing complexity

-   Let's bring people along with what we're gonna do

-   Decisions from kickoff meeting

-   Problem statement: A digital consumer who is trying to do business with GSA's Acq team, faces a hard time complete transactions in GSA's digital presence.

-   Focus: digital aspect of changes needed.

-   How will we investigate this problem further:

-   Interviews with key stakeholders, snowball to additional as needed

-   What we discussed in today's weekly update call

-   Narrowing focus to web governance of Acq-related GSA domain

-   GSA Schedules as potential test case

-   Potential investigation of usefulness of blockchain technology

-   Refined proposal based on discussion. We know you want to get to content, IA, and branding, plus explore new technologies; we want to help you do it right.

-   Problem statement:

-   Without a governance structure, GSA employees do not have a common playbook for how to strategize, write or manage content anywhere on the GSA.gov domain.

-   Successful outcome of PA:

-   Identify key/"domino effect" opportunities/challenges in current content mgmt landscape

-   Use learnings to identify important design elements of future governance model

-   Develop recommendations for strategic starting point (seamless transition to E&I)

-   Identify next steps

-   How we'll get there:

-   Assess the current content management workflow

-   Research: Explore GSA Drupal instance, analytics, SEO crawlers, policy assessment

-   Identifying untapped opportunities and exploring common pain points

-   Research: interviews, heatmapping

-   Create database for GSA internal improvement ideas

-   Ongoing Review of db to leverage ideas in PA

-   Share across GSA to build buy-in, engagement

-   Example: <https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=inv3uJNNzt7cCUTIn&inviteToken=c834ad0ea2108b75399481a801e63aae33e5dc849a4f4a0b0e49ac045ac7204c>

-   Here's our thinking behind proposal:

-   We think we see an "Iceberg" of issues here:

-   Problem: Look/feel of GSA's Acq domain lacks brand continuity or consistency.

-   Fix!: We could develop consistent guidelines (brand, content, et. al.) for GSA and improve the tone of the domain.

-   Even if you fix that, Problem: navigating/finding information is hard, Acq transactions suffer.

-   Fix!: Use customer and employee feedback to overhaul the content and IA, make it more flexible to future adaptation, to better clarify what GSA offers and help customers decide what they want to do.

-   Even if you fix that, Problem: Without a governance structure, GSA employees do not have a common playbook for how to strategize, write or manage content anywhere on the GSA.gov domain.

-   Digital transformation is complex. Without assessing what's happening at the root, it can be difficult to propose sustainable solutions to problems at the surface. We recommend tackling the issue at the root.

-   Specifying a test case could cause you to miss insights into opportunities/challenges necessary to build a future-proof GSA-wide scalable governance model. We recommend avoiding a specific test case until we learn more about the current state.

-   Here's a chance to be inventive! With no existing governance policies, there are opportunities to fill gaps that can evolve along with the GSA.gov domain.

Funding status:

-   As of 9/15/2018, we have spent $9,336 and have $760,664 remaining

-   Reminder: Funding numbers are always one week behind.
