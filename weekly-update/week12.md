Greetings, everyone.

We have had several great meetings this week with stakeholders from the Vendor Education Center, SAM.gov, and eBuy that have further accelerated our understanding about initiatives ongoing within GSA and to communicate OSC's overall vision for an integrated visual design. Â 

Moving forward, we will sync with design teams as we help OSC develop framing documents that will eventually inform GSA design system, digital governance, and content guidelines deliverables. VEC team gave us more insight to their process and their long term needs. Michael and Paul were excited to see time being spent on their product, and were very helpful in answering the teams questions. We've also been busy with learning about the design progress being made for the ongoing redesigns for eBuy and beta.sam.gov. Additionally, the eBuy presentation was very helpful in learning about decisions, audiences and the systems being used.

The team has worked on drafting the user preference plan and developing a plan of items within scope to be tested. The local testing environment setup for Drupal has been more challenging than we anticipated, but with some help are hoping to have that into place into next week.

Completed this week:

-   Meeting with eBuy

-   Meeting with beta.sam and eBuy stakeholders and design leads

-   Draft of testing plan

-   Continue Drupal local testing environment setup

-   Identified potential vendors for user preference testing

Goals next week:

-   Completion of testing plan

-   Coordinating vendor list contacts for January testing

-   Completion of Drupal local testing environment

-   Scheduling follow-up meetings with eBuy and SAM.gov design teams

-   Begin to roadmap post-project transition plan

Blockers

-   OSC needs a dedicated product owner for the digital presence
