Hello from Friday!

This week, our team has been heads down iterating on prototyping a Vendor Education Center experience styled with the U.S. Web Design System.

We've also been preparing for next Wednesday's meeting (December 12th) from 1230-2pm (Eastern). During our visit, members of our team will present progress and a roadmap of the rest of the project, and to participate in the Federal Marketplace Industry Day that morning.

Next week besides traveling to and from D.C. for the presentation, we'll finalize user preference testing, targeting potential vendors who can help us iterate on the prototype. Our team will also meet with the POC for Vendor Education Center.

We added another part-time engineer to the project this week, Scott Weber who is based in Louisville, who joins Carter to accelerate our development capacity for this project.

You can track our project tasks on[  Github](https://github.com/18F/osc-website-pa/projects/1).

Funding status:

-   As of 12/1/18, we have spent $297,676 and have $472,323 remaining. At our projected burn rate, the project will cease funding around mid-February.

Best,

Ron, Torey, Austin, Jeff, Olesya, Carter, Scott
