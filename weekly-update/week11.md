Greetings, everyone.

We have had a busy week that included our in-person meeting at GSA on Wednesday, December 12th. As we’ve said since the beginning of the project, our goal is to reimagine a portion of GSA’s web presence. 

Using the Vendor Education Center ([http://vec.gsa.gov](http://vec.gsa.gov/)) as a guidepost, we presented our beginning progress on a user-centered design that includes elements from the USWDS and how that could be applied to this portion of the website and rolled out to additional sections. The meeting had great conversation and our progress so far was well received by the larger group.

Also, the team used their time in DC to touch base with other members of OSC and make introductions.

Completed this week:

- Met with VEC staff. 
- In-person meeting at GSA headquarters- including going to the Federal Marketplace meeting at the Department of Interior 
- Activated[cloud.gov](http://cloud.gov/) hosting environment for prototyping 
- Continue design iterations for new vendor journey 
- Made contacts to provide vendor list for usability testing 

Goals next week:

- More collaboration with OSC partners Cloudburst group 
- Continue design iterations for new vendor journey 
- Facilitate a conversation with GSA’s usability testing vendor to plan usability testing for next sprint 
- Begin testing plan 
- Get updated plain language needed for VEC from OSC 
- Research[beta.sam.gov](http://beta.sam.gov/) 

Blockers

- Identify a Product Owner or plan to identify a Product Owner for OSC
