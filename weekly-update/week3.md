Hi Team,

We're full on in data-collection mode! We've conducted a lot of interviews, and begun to synthesize some of that data into initial insights. Some of these insights you'll see outlined below...more to come next week! Also next week, we'll be involving you more directly in our daily work, and expanding weekly discussions to include our stakeholders. We're hoping to dig more heavily into the data to generate some more initial findings, especially to draw out some connections across interview and analytic data. We've got synthesis planned in Week 5, which should be a fun opportunity roll up our sleeves together and dive in!

Completed this week:

-   Web analytics:  At this time, looks like we have enough to work with

-   Reminder: [Trello](https://trello.com/b/fGlFYb3w/osc-gsa-web-presence) lists the specific tasks we're working on, and [Airtable](https://airtable.com/tbls07DbrKNq3Ux1X/viwZsdKcxh51u2XeC) is where we're documenting improvement ideas as we learn of them.

Funding status:

-   As of 9/29/18 we have spent $50,746 and have $122,254 remaining on the PA phase. We have $719,254 remaining in total.

-   Reminder: Funding numbers are always one week behind.

Thanks,

Ron, Olesya, Corey, Eleni

Initial insights:

-   Less is more. 78.3% of GSA.gov traffic is to just 50 pages.

-   Over 26 million page views (51% of site traffic)  were to just three pages:

-   per diem rates

-   Per diem lookup

-   M&IE breakdown

-   Desktops still rule. Half of global web traffic is accessed via mobile devices, but over 80% of visitors to GSA.gov use desktops.

-   URL structure is structured by org chart. A crawl of 500 pages increments of various key traffic parts of GSA.gov (specifically within gsa.gov/acquisitions) showed that over 80% of content lives three layers or beyond from the top level.

-   Definition: Semantic URLs are web addresses that make it easier for search engines (and people interpreting analytics) know where people are going. By default, content management systems don't usually do this. You have to structure them to do it.

-   Example: GSA schedules page is located at <https://www.gsa.gov/acquisition/purchasing-programs/gsa-schedules> and any pages under GSA schedules falls under the GSA schedules subdirectory on the website. This is a logical way to organize content from an internal perspective, but it's bad for findability/discovery, because someone would need to know they were looking for GSA schedules under the Acquisitions tab to find it. Most people (according to analytics) search to find this, as a way to circumvent the site's structure, but that's an extra step users shouldn't be required to make.

-   Suggestion: In a better structure, GSA schedules could be found on their own via schedules.gsa.gov or gsa.gov/schedules, dredging the content from three levels (and more) beneath the main directory, to just one level (or within its own subdomain)

-   Example: Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) content represents over 1% of traffic to the entire site, but is housed in a sub-sub directory.

Good signs we're on track:

-   With the remaining folks we hope to interview, we feel comfortable we're talking to someone from all the groups relevant to our current problem statement. Snowball sampling ("who else should we speak to?" seems to confirm this too.

-   Problem statement seems to still be relevant based on what we've learned so far. Let's keep our eyes open for learnings that'll suggest refinements to it.

Big themes and questions that are emerging for us:

-   Which parts of GSA feel well served by GSA.gov? Where is that collaboration going great, and why? (We've heard a few good examples of successful projects, and hope to learn more in that direction!)

-   What is the role of search, and what do we want it to be? What is the role of discovery, and what do we want it to be? We're hearing --- and seeing --- that people use off-site search to find things within GSA.gov; there's likely a strategic decision to make here about whether/how much of a problem this is.

-   How can GSA.gov break the tyranny of the org chart --- and should it? We're learning that the site's structure, boundaries, and navigation are heavily dictated by the org chart and GSA's organizational norms. This is common for large orgs, but doesn't reflect the relative popularity or relevance of information. How can the process of redesigning the site reflect GSA's business processes  without forcing visitors to understand them in order to easily navigate the site?

-   Previous efforts to create a governance structure seem to emphasize creating organizational structures (like committees) and artifacts (like plans/policies). What kind of daily organizational practices support these?
