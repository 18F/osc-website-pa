Will there be snow this weekend in DC?

This has been a heads-down week for the team, as we've been ramping up work on deliverables, and developing the strategy for next steps. In order to get there, we had a number of working sessions as a team, along with OSC, and the end result is good progress that we'll continue to build on.

Next week, we have several meetings scheduled with stakeholders that will crystalize a number of issues, as well as further iteration on deliverables.

Completed this week:

-   Paired with OSC on post-project roadmap & rollout strategy planning

-   Met with GSA API team

-   Setup USWDS theme in Drupal test environment

-   GSA domain ecosystem targeting

-   Iteration on VEC prototype

-   Completed user preference testing research protocol

Goals next week:

-   Vendor research interview

-   Presentation with SAM.gov and ebuy teams to discuss collaborative efforts

-   Follow-up with Mike Powell to discuss VEC prototype demo changes

-   Continue iteration on content, design, and digital governance guidelines artifacts

-   Coordinate with GSA IT & OSC to discuss Drupal
