* If the GSA domain is structured like a tree with multiple branches, our research strategy can be described like this

    * We collect data with analytics and heatmapping to tell us what’s happening at the top layers of our tree. Since Acq is a clear pain point for GSA, we’ve decided to focus down that one branch. So we’ll use an SEO crawler to understand the IA one branch of the tree. Since analytics tells us what is happening but not how or why, we interview stakeholders within that branch to understand their perspectives. This enables us to understand the whole tree at the surface, dig deeper into one column layers of the digital presence, and identify where there may be differences between what the data shows and what opportunities/challenges stakeholders report.
