Hi Team,

This week, we continued interviewing stakeholders, getting some interesting new perspectives on the role of different organizations (PBS and Enterprise Strategy Management) within GSA, and conducted our Friday opportunity mapping workshop, which helped us get closer to synthesizing findings and recommendations.

We also ramped up our new team members, Austin Hernandez and Jeff Durland, who have been reading through the interviews, research, and background information on this project.

Going into next week, we'll be very heads down into synthesis. We have a lot of information we've poured over, and incorporating our new capacity into thinking broadly about what we've learned to make sure that our next steps are thoughtful and build onto the previous work to move us forward.

Completed this week:

-   Interviews

-   LaFondra Lynch

Goals for next week:
