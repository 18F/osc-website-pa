Since presenting our findings last week, we've had a number of conversations with OSC and various vendor partners in an effort to determine how to synchronize our efforts. We've also been integrating new documents such as including Cloudburst's plan for a content audit of the small business pages on GSA.gov, and the visual and content style guides for GSA into our larger plans for moving the digital presence forward in the timeframe we have in this engagement.

Our team spent time exploring the supplier journey by replicating the experience suppliers go through on the various sites, and thinking about where we can have an impact. On Monday Nov. 19th, we'll discuss a project timeline based on the information we've learned this week, as we've been refining our roadmap for the 12 weeks of experimentation and iteration (E&I) which is targeted to begin the week of Nov. 26th.

You can track our project tasks on [Github](https://github.com/18F/osc-website-pa/projects/1).
