Hello!

This week we've been digesting last week's opportunity mapping exercise and learning more about all aspects of customer interaction with GSA sites.

One of the foremost things on our minds this week is understanding scope. Each stakeholder we've asked gives a different answer about the scope of the problem. In the coming weeks, we'll aim to answer: What is OSC's mandate, especially for sites 'owned' by other offices? We want to document what properties are within OSC's scope, so we're prepared to work with the right stakeholders to make decisions.

One order of business: to make the most of everyone's time, we recommend a virtual meeting for the Path Analysis final presentation. We'd like to make our next in-person meeting the kickoff of the E&I phase with our full team present.

_Completed this week:_

-   Delivered stakeholder interview map

-   Opportunity mapping exercise synthesis

-   Shared heat-mapping results of various GSA.gov pages

-   Analyzed FMP research findings & the research background suggested in those documents, including the ITC self-service interviews

-   Submitted request for GSA auxiliary domain analytics

-   Talked with Jonathan Hooper (18F Engineer with single sign-on expertise)

-   Interview: Judith Zawatsky

Goals for next week:

-   Complete final stakeholder interview for this phase (Vicky Niblett)

-   Conduct exploration session about blockchain with Dave Kane-Parry (18F Engineer)

-   Deliver report & recommendations

-   Make staffing recommendations for project

-   Deliver roadmap for experiment & iterate phase

-   Timeframe and estimated deliverables

-   Meet with existing GSA.gov support contractors  to help us scope the next stage and better understand how to provide a broad vision for facilitating work in the long run.

You can track our project tasks on [Github](https://github.com/18F/osc-website-pa/projects/1).

Funding status:

-   As of 10/20/18, we have spent $129,835 and have $640,165 remaining. (Funding numbers are always one week behind.)

Thanks,

Opportunity mapping

Attached is an overview of the opportunities you identified during last week's opportunity mapping exercise.

Among these were:

-   Define a few KPIs to focus on
    Over the past six weeks, we've recognized there are two streams of thinking around GSA.gov -- large, strategic opportunities requiring a great deal of cross-department coordination --- and smaller, localized opportunities that could provide quicker benefits to the stakeholders GSA wants to prioritize.

-   Set standards or define principles
    Our research has revealed a consistent appetite across GSA for standards around both visual design and content. In contrast to past efforts that we researched, these could be included in a 'playbook' model that encourages widespread adoption through modeling good content on a few prototype areas of the site. Coupled with internal evangelism from a product team, there could be good gains realized that flow directly to users.

Our work has uncovered a number of potential opportunities that could also be worth investing in. We'll include more in the final report, but one we thought was worth sharing now:

GSA.gov as a product, not a communications tool. This is less a opportunity, and more of a paradigm shift.
