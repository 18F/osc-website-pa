Week 4
======

Greetings,

After a good week of synthesis, and discussing some high-level findings, we made the decision to build out our team's capacity towards building something tangible sooner rather than later. The refreshed homepage and navigation of GSA.gov gives us opportunities to benchmark this rapid iteration against our previous findings, which is timely given we've completed the purchase of heatmapping software.

In this upcoming week, we'll ramp up towards an opportunity mapping workshop on Friday, onboard our new team members, and orient towards asking ourselves "what makes sense to build?" in the coming weeks, and map that path.

Since our last update:

-   Completed

-   Interviews

-   Bill Zielinski (FAS)

-   LaFondra Lynch (PBS)

-   Added Austin (Visual Design) & Jeff (Content Design) to project team

-   Acquired Crazy Egg (heatmapping software)

-   Synthesized interview quotes into categorized findings for us to work with in this week's workshop

-   Created a project Github repository for public sharing of information. (Right now it's pretty sparse, but that'll change!) (https://github.com/18F/osc-website-pa)

Goals for this week:

-   Workshop for Friday - Opportunity mapping and discussion

-   Heatmapping GSA.gov

-   Sharing interview mural with team

Funding status:

-   As of the week ending 10/13, we have spent $99,559 and have $670,440 remaining

-   Reminder: Funding numbers are always one week behind.

Big question:

-   A lot of past work has gotten us to this point. Among those efforts, what have you discussed, explored, or tried? What options do you want to consider when we think through opportunities on Friday?

Thanks,

Ron, Corey, Olesya, Austin, Jeff
