Hello!

The project has turned a corner this week, as we've begun work on a prototype. As we've said since the beginning of the project, our goal is to reimagine a portion of GSA's web presence. Using the Vendor Education Center (<http://vec.gsa.gov>) as a guidepost, our team has spent this week (and most of last week) deep-diving into the supplier journey. This includes the morass of sites, sub-sites, and external links that journey contains to look at the ways that we can potentially improve the process.

Next Wednesday, our team will be in-person in D.C. at GSA headquarters. In addition to the update presentation we've scheduled (from 11am-1pm, if you did not receive an invite, please reply and let us know!) we'll also have time that day to meet with you.

Completed this week:

-   Met with GSA CIO team to discuss current efforts.

-   Investigated GSA OSC branding efforts with Patrick Son.

-   Solidified on a potential GSA-wide architectural model to prototype

-   Drafted a journey to reimagine the Vendor Education Center "Pathway to Success" narrated PowerPoint presentation

-   Started a design to instantiate this new vendor journey

Blockers

-   Can someone connect us with the point of contact for vec.gsa.gov (Vendor Education Center?) We've sent a few emails to folks regarding this, but haven't had a conversation with anyone yet.

You can track our project tasks on [Github](https://github.com/18F/osc-website-pa/projects/1).

Funding status:

-   As of 11/24/18, we have spent $261,334 and have $508,665 remaining. At our projected burn rate, the project will cease funding around mid-February.
