Greetings, everyone.

The project has turned a corner this week, as we've begun work on a prototype. As we've said since the beginning of the project, our goal is to reimagine a portion of GSA's web presence. Using the Vendor Education Center ([http://vec.gsa.gov](http://vec.gsa.gov/)) as a guidepost, our team has been exploring deep into the supplier journey. This includes the morass of sites, sub-sites, and external links that journey contains to look at the ways that we can potentially improve the process.

Next Wednesday, our team will be in-person in D.C. at GSA headquarters. In addition to the update presentation we've scheduled (from 11am-1pm, if you did not receive an invite, please reply and let us know!) we'll also have time that day to meet with you.

Also this week, we welcomed product manager Torey Vanek to 18F and onto this project. As of now, we are a fully staffed team.

Completed this week:

-   Met with GSA CIO team to discuss current efforts

-   Investigated GSA OSC branding efforts with Patrick Son

-   Solidified on a potential GSA-wide architectural model to prototype

-   Drafted a journey to reimagine the Vendor Education Center "Pathway to Success" narrated PowerPoint presentation

-   Started a design to instantiate this new vendor journey

Goals next week:

-   Connect with VEC point of contact

-   More collaboration with OSC partners Cloudburst group

-   In-person meeting at GSA headquarters

-   Activate cloud.gov hosting environment for prototyping

-   Continue design iterations for new vendor journey

-   Facilitate a conversation with GSA's usability testing vendor to plan usability testing for next sprint

Blockers

-   Can someone connect us with the point of contact for vec.gsa.gov (Vendor Education Center?) We've sent a few emails to folks regarding this, but haven't had a conversation with anyone yet.

You can track our project tasks on [Github](https://github.com/18F/osc-website-pa/projects/1).

Funding status:

-   As of 11/24/18, we have spent $261,334 and have $508,665 remaining. At our projected burn rate, the project will cease funding around mid-February.

Thanks,

Torey, Austin, Jeff, Olesya, Carter, Ron
