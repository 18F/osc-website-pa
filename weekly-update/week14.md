Welcome to 2019!

We have spent the last two weeks completing our prototyping environment for Drupal. Because of some issues with Docker, setting it up on local machines was more complex than anticipated, but thanks to some additional DevOps help from 18F engineers, we've moved onto the next stage of the build process. We also connected with GSA's API lead, to discuss our needs and have submitted a request around NAICS/SIN codes.

Also, we met with Mark Vogelgesang as a follow-up to a bigger meeting we had last month. We briefed him on our project scope, learned about the how the Vendor Education Center integrates with Salesforce, and discussed how our efforts might demonstrate a working model of how to better content within the VEC in the future. At present, it's very cumbersome and costly to maintain.

Torey met with Sarah and Boaz to talk about Product Owner tasks. They plan to meet again next week to begin a roadmap of tasks to roll out the design patterns to GSA web properties.

Next week, we'll begin a new sprint centered around building and research. We'll be talking to some vendors, employing user preference testing of existing designs and our prototype, and synthesize those findings to come up with ways to refine our final deliverables for OSC over the coming weeks.

Completed this week:

-   Meeting with Mark about VEC

-   Creating vendor list contacts for January testing

-   Completion of Drupal local environment

-   Rough draft of content guidelines

-   Connected with GSA's API lead

Goals next week:

-   Finalize vendor research scheduling

-   Additional meetings with OSC to refine next steps beyond deliverables

-   Follow-up with VEC team to discuss content enhancements for prototype

-   Setting up the US Web Design System in Drupal prototype

-   Researching a rapid solution for NAICS/SIN lookup API

-   Refine content governance framework draft

You can track our project tasks on[  Github](https://github.com/18F/osc-website-pa/projects/3).

Funding status:

-   As of the week ending 12/29/2018, we have spent $433,457 and have $336,542 remaining.
